Demos for a few Faiss functionalities
=====================================


demo_auto_tune.py
-----------------

Demonstrates the auto-tuning functionality of Faiss


demo_e_means.py
---------------

Runs the DEEP1M e-means quality experiment on a PyTorch device and reports the
median held-out MSE over ten seeds. Download Deep1B as described in
`../benchs/README.md` and pass the directory containing `deep1b/`:

    python demos/demo_e_means.py --data-dir /path/to/data

A representative CUDA run ends with `median test MSE 0.387950`, within 0.02%
of the 0.38788 reference result for this experiment.


demo_ondisk_ivf.py
------------------

Shows how to construct a Faiss index that stores the inverted file
data on disk, eg. when it does not fit in RAM. The script works on a
small dataset (sift1M) for demonstration and proceeds in stages:

0: train on the dataset

1-4: build 4 indexes, each containing 1/4 of the dataset. This can be
done in parallel on several machines

5: merge the 4 indexes into one that is written directly to disk
(needs not to fit in RAM)

6: load and test the index
